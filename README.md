### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://satvna.github.io/frontendmentor-product-preview-card/)

## My process
- Separated text into divs for structure
- Separated image and info into two different halves
- Styled with flex and grid
- Developed mobile view with media queries by changing flex-direction, height, and width
### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-second workflow (my bad)

### What I learned
- Not to be afraid of media queries
- Setting html and body to 100% width/height allows you to take up the entire viewport
- There is an onclick property for divs
- Margins are a good way to move elements up & down, while still in flex or grid containers
